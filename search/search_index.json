By organizing workshops, seminars, and online content, we aim to demonstrate the value and versatility of open source tools for various geospatial applications. Foster Community Growth Our mission is to build a stronger and more engaged community of geospatial enthusiasts in Nepal. Through regular meetups, webinars, and collaborative projects, we provide a platform for networking, knowledge sharing, and skill development. Empower through Education Education continues to be a cornerstone of our efforts. We are dedicated to providing learning resources, training materials, and hands-on sessions that empower individuals with the skills needed to harness open source geospatial technologies effectively. Advocate for Open Data and Standards We persist in advocating for the use of open data and standards in Nepal's geospatial landscape. By promoting interoperability and the sharing of geospatial data, we contribute to a more accessible and transparent geospatial ecosystem.","title":"Objectives"},{"location":"Contributing/CONTRIBUTING/","text":"Contributing to OSGeoNepal \u00b6 Prerequisites \u00b6 Before you start your journey, make sure you have the following: GitHub Account: Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.
